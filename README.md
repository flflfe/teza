# teza - powered by Tezos

A minimalistic Tezos wallet that helps in storing and sending/receiving funds with ease. It is secure as it is build totally on the Tezos platform. I have used Hive for the on-device storage as it is fast and helps in storing the data securely. Apart from this, it has a very minimalist UI.
